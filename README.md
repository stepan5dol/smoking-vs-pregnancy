# Prediction of birth weight class using Gradient Boosting &amp; Feature Engineering
## Abstract
In this study, we explored a Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debjeetdas/babies-birth-weight) containing information about mothers and their newborn children. We addressed data gaps, categorized the samples into gestation age groups and body weight classes, and conducted a statistical analysis. Our findings revealed a higher prevalence of smoking among mothers in the low body weight group. To focus on predicting low body weight using early features, we defined two body weight classes: 'Normal weight' and 'Low body weight.' We selected five features that could be determined before and during early stages of pregnancy for training machine learning models.

Among all the tested models, smoking emerged as the most significant feature. The best-performing model achieved an impressive ROC-AUC score of 94.8% on the test data, indicating its potential for accurately predicting low body weight in early stages. This outcome suggests that our model can be effectively utilized as a predictive tool for identifying cases of low birth weight.
